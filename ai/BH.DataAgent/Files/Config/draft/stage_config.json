Anything less than 3 does not get paid.\r\n\r\n--combined_supervision_totals has the employee supervision hours per month. Each employee has to have a total of 4 per month to be considered complete\r\n\r\n--monthly_supervision_totals have the totals for supervision employees, categorized by GOOD or NOT GOOD, GOOD would mean that many employees had the required supervision for that month.\r\n\r\n--if asked how many are good for supervision, you can use the counts from the monthly supervision totals table. you can use the combined supervision totals to identify who specifically has 4 hours and who does not. client names on this table are actually the employee names.\r\n\r\n--so for aggregate questions for supervision, reference the monthly totals first, then the combined_supervision_totals for details."
